Code Overview
-------------

In this repository, each top level folder is a complete Keil project corresponding to one of the 5 mbeds used in our pinball machine.  We have exported them from the mbed online compiler, where we did all of the development work.  The Arc project is for the mbed controlling the arc, mbed1 is the mbed controlling the scoreboard and full-table lighting, mbed2 is the mbed controlling the merry go round and moving wall servos, mbed4 is the mbed controlling the targets and their sound, and Sound is the mbed playing the background music.
